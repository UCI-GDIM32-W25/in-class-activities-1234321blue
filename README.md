# GDIM32 In Class Activities
## Week 1
### Activity 1
Some advice that our table came up with was to predict how long an assignment might take you in order to get in on time, not finishing it up in the last minute. We also said that it was important to utilize class resources, whether it be the la tech hours, unity documentation, or even just lecture and or pre-learning slides.
### Activity 2
1. x = 10
2. x = 2
3. They would print into the Unity console the words "hello word" every frame. 
4. MonoBehaviour
5. When the game starts up, it will call the "PrintMessage" method with its argument being 10. The method itself prints into the console the phrase "x = " and adds on the inputed argument at the end of it. Overall, at the start of the game, the message "x = 10" will print out once in the console.
6. The highlighted pieces of code are the arguments, which give an input into the respective method that is trying to be called.
7. In Update, the object's Transform class is defined as _playerTransform, which should be used instead.
8. _playerTransform
