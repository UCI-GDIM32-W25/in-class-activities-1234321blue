# GDIM32 In Class Activities
## Week 1
### Activity 1
Some advice that our table came up with was to predict how long an assignment might take you in order to get in on time, not finishing it up in the last minute. We also said that it was important to utilize class resources, whether it be the la tech hours, unity documentation, or even just lecture and or pre-learning slides.
### Activity 2
1. x = 10
2. x = 2
3. They would print into the Unity console the words "hello word" every frame. 
4. MonoBehaviour
5. When the game starts up, it will call the "PrintMessage" method with its argument being 10. The method itself prints into the console the phrase "x = " and adds on the inputed argument at the end of it. Overall, at the start of the game, the message "x = 10" will print out once in the console.
6. The highlighted pieces of code are the arguments, which give an input into the respective method that is trying to be called.
7. In Update, the object's Transform class is defined as _playerTransform, which should be used instead.
8. _playerTransform

I added the basic game objects such as the player character, the ground, and the UI. Along with this, I added a Player script and coded it to make the player jump when you press space.

### Activity 1
When you add multiple Locator objects to the scene and run the game, though the empty object itself will not be destroyed, the Locator component on these objects will disappear besides one. This happens because, on Awake, the Locator class will check if there are other Locator classes and if they are the this, and is so, they will destroy, eventually just leaving one Locator class.

### Activity 3
I added the sprites into the game and created the basic visual assets of the game, such as the bird and the floor. I also changed the aspect ratio to better fit the game of floppy bird.
